-get trackball working
-update mouse demo to dynamically change controllers between stmouse, amigamouse, trackball, or joystick
-integrate the macro based PLOTSPRITE
-fix tallsprite so it's DASM constants holding state, rather than C globals
-enable plotmap to be wider than 32 bytes (i.e. break it up into 2 plotmaps) , provided the width parameter isn't used.
-vertical scrolling, in earnest
